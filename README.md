# SecurityAlgorithms
This repository contains implementations and simulations of various security algorithms. 
The implementations were done as a part of an advanced security course at Lund University, faculty of engineering.

Note, that SHA1 is used as hash function in many of the implementations, this only for simplicity and demonstrational purposes.
SHA1 should never be used in any real-world application!
